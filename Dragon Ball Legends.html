                        I will teach you how to identify patterns, understand
                        the technicalities and much more. But, keep in mind that
                        this is a very long process of understanding these
                        concepts, because although you can understand it
                        theoretically(or not), It will take you at least a year
                        or less depending on level of mindfullness, your diet
                        regimen, mental health, and of course, passion.

                    This is the bad side of the game. unfortunately, there are
                    prerequisite to play PVP, so you either have to spend money
                    or save up until good characters come in. You have to use
                    teams relative to what is meta and to understand what is
                    meta, check the leaderboards and start your inferences
                    there(assuming lazyness) There are F2P characters that you
                    can use but it most be the latest ones, not the old ones.
                    and you can use them relative to your level of skill.
                    Ultimately, you have to save your gems and choose what team
                    you will use and commit to that team, because it takes a
                    long while for the team to be unusable.

                <p class="Fourth-P">
                    There are different levels of mindgames. To raise your level
                    of critical thinking skills is relative to diet,
                    mindfullness, how much you train your critical thinking
                    skills, mood, and sleeping schedule. So your level isn't
                    always consistent, and if you don't maximize what I said,
                    you will play differently and you will create limited
                    beliefs on top of that, making yourself harder to go back to
                    your genuine skill. So it is better off to play with
                    maximizing all than to half-ass it and to minimize the
                    suffering.

                <p class="Fourth-P">
                    Playing consciously is your true skill, while playing
                    unconsciously is not, so you will waste time if you play the
                    latter, because you will play without being aware of
                    opponent's pattern.
                </p>
                <ul class="Fourth-P">
                    I will give you my concepts to understand how mindgames work
                    and test them to see if you see where I'm pointing to. Here
                    are the 4 patterns:
                </ul>
                <li>Movement Pattern</li>
                <li>Strike Pattern</li>
                <li>Blast Pattern</li>
                <li>Special Move Pattern</li>

                <p class="Fourth-P">
                    Movement pattern is how you move during specific
                    circumstances. Example: Your opponent's movement will change
                    when you're in mid range or long range, and they wiil
                    unconsciously create a pattern.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Firstly, To know how to read one's pattern is to pay
                    attention. without paying attention, you will not read
                    anyone and most likely go with your emotions, also will not
                    improve in mindgames.
